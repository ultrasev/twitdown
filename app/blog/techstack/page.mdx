# TwitDown Technical Stack

## Frontend Architecture

Our frontend is built with Next.js 14, leveraging the power of React Server Components and the App Router. Here's why we chose these technologies:

- **Next.js App Router**: Provides superior routing and data fetching capabilities
- **React Server Components**: Reduces client-side JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with utility classes

## Backend Services

We use a combination of serverless technologies:

- **Hono**: Lightweight, type-safe backend framework
- **Upstash Redis**: For rate limiting and caching
- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent storage

## Performance Optimizations

Our application achieves excellent performance metrics through:

- Server-side rendering
- Aggressive caching strategies
- Image optimization
- Code splitting
